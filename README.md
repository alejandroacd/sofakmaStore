# funcionalities âœ…

SofakmaStore contains a catalog of photos, whose information is collected from an api in the cloud (made by me, through MongoDB). The website is capable of storing the photos in a cart that you can then pay for. In the cart section you can add the same item more times, as well as subtract a unit. Also delete it completely. For this I use localStorage.

Mercadopago is used as a payment gateway, but it is configured as a test mode, with all the tests successful.
